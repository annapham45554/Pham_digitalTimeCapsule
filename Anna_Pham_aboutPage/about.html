<p>Anna's real name is Truc Pham, but she prefers to be called Anna. She is an aspiring UI Designer and a Visual Communication 
    Design student at San Francisco State University. She is a green lover, a deep overthinker, and a lazy artist. Her passion is 
    doing anything that involves creativity. Sometimes she just loves to chill and do whatever she feels like at the moment. 
    </p>
<p>Anna was born on October 16, 2001, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. She is the youngest sister in a quadruplet. Growing 
    up, she has always wanted to be an artist who specializes in fine arts and modern arts. But she realized that realistically, 
    she could not make those full-time because they were not stable enough for a living wage. So she thought to herself, 
    in this modern day and age, what kind of art career can give her stable living wages? What kind of career aligns with 
    her interests but is also stable enough to help her pay for things? Surely enough, these questions helped 
    her find a passion for graphic design and UI/UX design.</p>
<p>Anna has moderate hearing loss, a disability that she was born with. She has a problem with listening to low voices. 
    Male voices are generally lower so they are pretty hard for her ears to listen to, but female voices that are too soft 
    are hard for her to listen to as well. Additionally, she has a speech impediment that results from her hearing loss. 
    It comes in a lisp and occasional mispronunciation. Despite this, she still listens and communicates normally, 
    and she does her best to ask questions every time she either mishears or cannot hear something.</p>
