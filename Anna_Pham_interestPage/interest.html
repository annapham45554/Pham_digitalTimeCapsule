    <section>
      <p>Anna is interested in fine arts, digital design, and User Interface Design 
        (she has a <a href="https://greenlife45554.wordpress.com/">UI website</a> dedicated to all of her 
        UI design projects). Besides doing creative work, she loves spending her free time scrolling on Social Media mindlessly. 
        She mainly uses Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit. She mostly uses them for entertainment purposes, and at the same time, 
        she uses them for art. Instagram, ArtStation, and Reddit are the go-to places for her to upload her artwork.</p>
        <p>In terms of music, Anna loves listening to a wide variety of music genres: Pop, Indie, Folk, Soft rock, 
          Classic, Country, Film score, EDM, Jazz, Blue, and K-pop. She is a Swiftie and loves listening to Taylor Swift's 
          music almost on a daily basis.</p>
