# Project 1: Digital Time Capsule
### by Anna Pham
## Project overview
The project is about building a personal website that describes the designerâ€™s identity, interests, and activities. The website has 4 pages: a home page, an about page, an interest page, and an activity page. 300+ words of introduction are written and divided on each page. 

The home page is used as a landing page, which has a GIF and a brief sentence of introduction. The other three pages have images and descriptions to demonstrate further detail of what the Home page talks about. Every page has a header and footer, a navigation bar, and one logo as a Home button. The menu is placed in the navigation bar (the header), and the contact information is placed in the footer. The website's overall color is green, with the header and footer being dark green and the main background being white-light green. The font type is Sans Serif, with two font families: Gill Sans Nova (Adobe fonts) and Poppins (Google fonts). The words in the menu navigation have the hover effect, which turns into a different color when the mouse hovers over it. 
## Technical overview
GIF animation was executed in Adobe Photoshop, and the illustration for the GIF and the logo was executed in Adobe Illustrator. Hand-drawn low-fidelity wireframes and Adobe XD were used for building the general hierarchy and visual layout of a website. The website was built in VSC (Visual Studio Code), where HTML and CSS are used for setting up the content and visual aspects. 

#### Elements that are frequently used in HTML are:
<ul>
<li>h1 h2 h3 (heading)</li>
<li>p (paragraph)</li>
<li>img (images) Used for both GIF and PNG or JPG images</li>
<li>div or div class and div id (target specific parts of a document)</li>
<li>ul li (unordered list)</li>
<li>header footer (for header and footer content)</li>
<li>nav (navigation)</li>
<li>br (line break)</li>
</ul>

#### Properties that are frequently used in CSS are:
<ul>
<li>Background-color or color (either fonts or border)</li>
<li>Padding</li>
<li>Margin</li>
<li>Fonts (size, type, family, style)</li>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>Text-align</li>
<li>Text-decoration</li>
<li>List-style-type</li>
<li>:hover</li>
<li>position: sticky</li>
<li>background image</li>
</ul>

## Acknowledgment
The website is still flawed and there are a few things that need to be improved or added. However, it is a good start for the first project.
